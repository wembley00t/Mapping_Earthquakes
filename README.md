# Mapping_Earthquakes

The purpose of this project was to add data to the original earthquake map.  The user now has the option to select Tectonic Plates, All Earthquakes or Major Earthquakes as an option.  The view can be the street, satellite or dark view.

Below are images from the options available.


All Options Selected - shows tectonic plates

Only earthquake option selected

Major earthquake option selected.  This option will show earthquakes with a magnitude larger than 6 in red, larger than 5 but less than 6 in orange and less than 5 in yellow.  For the last 7 days, there are no earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 6 and therefore no red is shown.

This final map is a dark image map of the same information.
